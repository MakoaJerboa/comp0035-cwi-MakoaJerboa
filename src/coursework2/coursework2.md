## Requirements
### Explanation of the choice of techniques
- For eliciting, I will use brainstorming. Since we cannot involve others with the coursework, we are restricted only to methods which can be done individually. Amongst these methods I have decided to use brainstorming since it is a simple and efficient way to consider many ideas simultaneously and evaluate which ones should be kept for the following sections.

- For documenting, I will use user stories. This format will help me focus on the user and how they would react to each requirement keeping the requirements more focussed on my target audience. It also helps document why each requirement is necessary which will help with prioritisation as well.

- For prioritising, I will use MoSCoW. This format is good because it clearly ranks which requirements are the most important but also considers which requirements are good but impractical to implement considering factors like time or budget needed compared to the value the function would provide.

### Prioritised requirements
My APP2 is a data visualisation dashboard

Some requirements I want:

UI should be simple with most options/menus clearly visible

Graphs must accurately represent data

Page shoud load on low end hardware so only load things which are needed / minimise system overhead

Users should be able to compare things easily, either with multiple on one graph or multiple things side by side
